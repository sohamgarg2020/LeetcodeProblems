This was a very challenging problem. Originally I thought could I just go through the linked list and all the elements into a list and then use merge sort. In terms of time complexity I think that should be O(nlogn) but space complexity would be O(n). The follow up said to make it O(1) for space complexity so I had to figure out a way to split up linked lists. Using a slow and fast pointer that would move twice the speed I separated the linked lists into 2, then used recursion, and then used the merge method.
