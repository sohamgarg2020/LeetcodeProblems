Started with a O(2^(m+n)) solution by checking every letter in comparision and then using recursion. 

Learned something about lru_cache(maxsize = None). Going to try and condense it even more using memoization (still learning that in progress).


In code2.py I added memoization so its a good alternative to lru_cache

In code3.py I added DP. Very interesting method to solve this problem. Took me a minute to understand how it worked but after I understood, I definitely got how to do it. Very very nice solution.
