Started with a O(2^(m+n)) solution by checking every letter in comparision and then using recursion. 

Learned something about lru_cache(maxsize = None). Going to try and condense it even more using memoization (still learning that in progress).


In code2.py I added memoization so its a good alternative to lru_cache
